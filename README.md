# Weather Dashboard
This is a weather app. The user enters a city name and is delivered the current and a 5-day forecaset. After the user enters a search, a history button is added to the webpage so they can easily retrieve previous results.

## Features

* City searches return the current weather conditions & a 5-day forecast
* Search history buttons for easy access to past searches
* Weather conditions include temperature, wind speed, humidity, UV index and a weather icon
* The UV index is color coded to indicate favorable (green) to server (purple) conditions
* If the user doesn't fill the city search field in, a modal popups up telling them to enter a city
